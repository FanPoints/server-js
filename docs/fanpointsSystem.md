# Overview

On this page, we explain the core concepts of the *FanPoints* system.


> In these blocks, we will guide you through a hypothetical example of AS Monaco using FanPoints to engage with their user base.

## Loyalty Programs

Each *FanPoints* loyalty program corresponds to a closed ecosystem in which users can participate, e.g. by collecting and spending Fan Points. A loyalty program is managed by the loyalty program owner.


> AS Monaco creates the "AS Monaco Loyalty Program" in order to engage with their fans.

## Users

Users are people participating in a *FanPoints* loyalty program.


> AS Monaco already has an app that is beloved among their large fanbase. Every app user is directly an "AS Monaco Loyalty Program" user because they integrate the loyalty program into their existing app.

## Partners

Partners are businesses that participate in one or more *FanPoints* loyalty programs. Users can interact and engage with partners in the same loyalty program. For instance, partners can distribute Fan Points to users and allow users to pay with Fan Points.


> The Casino de Monte-Carlo decides to become a partner in the "AS Monaco Loyalty Program". They build a special gambling machine that allows users to win Fan Points. Furthermore, users can buy chips using their collected Fan Points.

### Fan Points

Users can collect Fan Points by spending money at a partner. They can be used by users to get access to unique experiences provided by the partners in the loyalty program.

### Status Points

Status Points can be earned by users at partners when engaging with them. They do not have a monetary value. Partners can use the number of collected Status Points to give the most active users special benefits.

> The Casino de Monte-Carlo introduces a new poker game where only users with at least 1000 Status Points can participate.

# Modules

A loyalty program owner can enable modules in order to enable features for the users and partners.

Currently, the following modules are available:

- **User Module**: allows the loyalty program owner to add, modify and delete users.
- **Fan Points Module**: allows partners to distribute and collect Fan Points to users.
- **Status Points Module**: allows partners to reward users for engagement and offer special deals for users with a given number of Status Points.

# Accessing ad a FanPoints Loyalty Program

Loyalty program owners and partners can use the **FanPoints dashboard** to manage their loyalty program or their partner account respectively.

The **server-js** library allows loyalty program owners and partners to interact with the three modules on a programmatic level. The library is designed to be used in a backend.

The following access methods will be provided in the near future:

- **partner mobile app**: allows employees of partners to interact with the FanPoints system using a mobile app (e.g. to distribute Fan Points to users).

- **custom plugins** for Shopify and React Native and Flutter apps.
